The Anti-Defamation League and four other pro-Israel groups accused the American Association of University Professors of demonizing Israel in its framing of and publicity around a webinar titled Scholasticide in Palestine. Scholasticide is the intentional eradication of an education system. In a joint letter Thursday, the same day as the webinar, the ADL, the Academic Engagement Network, Hillel International, the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Federations of North America condemned the events use of this term. Language used in the events descriptionincluding scholasticide and exterminationistsuggests the adoption and promotion of a one-sided and inflammatory narrative which deviates from the mission of the AAUP, the letter said. The groups said theres no evidence of any intent by Israel to systemically destroy the education system in Gaza or elsewhere. The destruction of institutions, including educational ones, is a tragic byproduct of war, exacerbated when terror groups like Hamas embed their operations within school buildings and other civilian centers. Six months into the latest war in Gaza, a group of independent United Nations experts said in a news release, It may be reasonable to ask if there is an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system. By then, the release said, the last Gazan university had already been destroyed and more than 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors have been killed in Gaza, and over 7,819 students and 756 teachers have been injured. Miriam Elman, the Academic Engagement Networks executive director, provided Inside Higher Ed with an email from Donna Murch, a member of the AAUPs elected national council, inviting members to the webinar. Murch said the event would feature academics and right-to-education organizers who have experienced, documented and challenged Israels ongoing and systematic destruction of the education system in Palestine. An AAUP spokesperson told Inside Higher Ed, We are not aware that anyone who is objecting to AAUPs programming actually attended the event, which is part of an extended series of conversations about diverse topics of interest to our members. We take antisemitism very seriously and plan our programming consistent with the principles of academic freedom and academic responsibility that AAUP vigorously defends. The pro-Israel groups also criticized the AAUP events promotional material for not mentioning Hamass Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israelis. The letter says, We note with dismay that this divisive event is taking place within a wider context of the AAUP being perceived as increasingly moving in a virulently anti-Israel direction. The AAUP has received criticism for its councils August decision to abandon the groups nearly 20-year categorical opposition to academic boycottssuch as those often called for against Israel.

The Trump administration has the symbolic fight it wants, Brian Rosenberg writes. A March 5 webinar by the Presidents Alliance identified strategies institutions can take to aid undocumented, immigrant, refugee and international students. The executive order will likely impact thousands of nonprofit employees involved in activist work opposed by the president. Higher ed and free speech advocates are deeply alarmed by the decision to cancel 400 million in contracts and grants at the university, saying it is yet another example of executive overreach. The anti-DEI movement sounds like a row of cannons, but its legal attack is a rifle shot based on one provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Dan Currell writes.

After Hurricane Helene made landfall in September 2024, the Laurens County School District, just outside Greenville, S.C., partnered with Amy Starkey, a local therapeutic yoga instructor to help their students and teachers recover from the storm. Starkey worked to train teachers to incorporate mindful movement into their classrooms to support students recovery and well-being. The exercises theyve employedincluding deep breathing and yoga stretchescan be done at students desks without the need for a designated space, or special equipment like yoga mats. In surveys conducted by Starkey, teachers in the district observed significant improvements in students emotional regulation and behavioral challenges after just five weeks of yoga and mindfulness intervention. Students also reported using these techniques at home, empowering them to self-regulate in settings outside of the classroom. In addition to collecting data on the impact of incorporating yoga into the classroom, students shared their experiences and the other ways theyve used these learnings in their daily lives.
